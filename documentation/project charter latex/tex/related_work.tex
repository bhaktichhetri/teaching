Many fiducial recognition tables have already been created and exist. The Microsoft Surface, for example, worked using this kind of recognition. 
The current libraries that enable this sort of interaction are as follows:
The Reactivision library \cite{reactivision}.
The Bullseye Library \{bullseye}.
