This is a student project, so the background with many of these systems is sparse. We have developed applications for our classes in the past, have become familiar with the standard development cycle, and a few of us have worked in more advanced user interfaces. Our team will be designing a digital interface with professional engineering skills to provide solution to a real engineering world. Paul Medcalf who is the co-founder of the company AstroMutt will serve as a client for the development of the project. As client, AstroMutt will define the requirements for the project that is to be developed and provide feedback during the development process. Dr. McMurrough will be assisting and providing necessary directions and instructions throughout the development process of this project.
